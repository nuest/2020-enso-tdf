## Reproduce locally

To install all required packages for this analysis, please execute

```{r environment, eval = FALSE}
renv::init()
renv::install()
```

from the repository root.
The _renv_ package is the successor of the _packrat_ package and can be [installed from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=renv).
This will create a project-based R library in a subdirectory `renv` based on the lockfile `renv.lock`, with R packages being kept at a specific version for better reproducibility.
